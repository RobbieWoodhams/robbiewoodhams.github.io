Hello, my name is Robbie Woodhams, I am a third-year computer science student at the University of Plymouth. I created this page to enhance my learning, share knowledge, and improve my writing skills. Expect to find insights and revision notes from my academic journey, blogs on various tech related subjects, and discussing anything that piques my interest.

This page is a personal endeavour, serving as a digital journal where I document my thoughts and experiences. If you find any of the posts interesting, incorrect, or just want to chat, feel free to contact me through the socials provided. Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy reading from my perspective on the world.
