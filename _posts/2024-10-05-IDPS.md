## Introduction

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) are cybersecurity technologies designed to detect and prevent network-based attacks. This blog will cover the various types of IDPS systems, explore how they work, give real-world examples, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

## What is an intrusion?

To understand IDPS we must first explore what they designed to detect and prevent.
An intrusion in the context of cybersecurity refers to any unauthorised or malicious activity that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA triad) of an information system or network.

### Types of intrusion

1.	External Intrusions:
These are attacks originating from outside the network, typically conducted by hackers or cybercriminals. Common external intrusion methods include distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, phishing attempts, and brute-force login attacks.

2.	Internal Intrusions:
Internal intrusions involve insiders, such as employees or contractors, who have authorised access but misuse it for malicious purposes. Such intrusion methods include stealing confidential information or installing malware.

3.	Passive Intrusions:
A passive intrusion involves gathering information without altering the system. For example, a common passive intrusion includes eavesdropping on network traffic to intercept sensitive data such as passwords or financial details.

4.	Active Intrusions:
Active intrusions interact directly with the system. Such attacks include modifying or corrupting data, installing malware, or executing commands to damage or compromise the system.

### Consequences of an intrusion

An intrusion of any type is a major threat to any organisation. Organisations can incur financial costs due to theft, ransomware payments or legal fines. Sensitive information such as personal data, financial records, or intellectual property may be stolen. Furthermore, intruders may disrupt services, leading to downtime or denial of access to users for potentially life-saving technology.

Given the potentially severe consequences of intrusion, organisations must have strong defensive measures and rely on proactive technologies such as IDS and IPS to identify these threats before they cause harm.

## What are IDS and IPS?

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software or hardware product that monitors the events occurring in a computer system or network, analyses them for signs of intrusion, and raises an alert leaving the responsibility to a human analyst or other technology.
An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a software or hardware product that monitors network traffic and takes proactive actions to block malicious activities or security violations in real time. Responses may include blocking incoming network traffic, killing a malicious process, quarantining a file etc.

An IPS is also an IDS, however, the reverse is not always true. An IDS, as the name suggests, is designed to detect an intrusion whereas an IPS on the other hand actively works to prevent an attack from succeeding. 

## IDS vs IPS

Given an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) does everything an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can do and more why do IDS solutions still exist? The fact that IPS can perform the same detection functions as IDS but with the added ability to automatically prevent threats, raises the question of why IDS solutions are still relevant. Here is why IDS remains valuable in certain contexts despite the capabilities of IPS:

1.	Risk of false positives:
IDS only monitors and generates alerts, so if there's a false positive (an innocent action flagged a threat), there is no direct impact on the network availability or performance. The security team can review and take manual action.

2.	Forensics and Incident Response:
IPS generally focuses on preventing attacks and may not always retain details records of incidents, making IDS essential for security teams that need detailed logs for compliance, auditing, or forensics after an attack.

3.	Passive Monitoring:
IDS systems do not interfere with live traffic, as a result, they are ideal for monitoring without affecting network performance. This is especially important in environments where uptime and bandwidth usage are priorities.

4.	Flexibility:
IDS allows security teams to review and manually investigate alerts before implementing blocking actions, giving them control over responses. IPS may not offer the same degree of customization in terms of how the network responds to specific threats.

5.	Cost:
Generally deploying IPS technology can be more costly due to the more advanced systems that require better processing capabilities. IDS is a more cost-effective solution when real-time prevention isn’t critical.

## Host-Based vs Network-Based Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDPS)

Intrusion detection or protection systems can also be classified based on what they protect.  IDS or IPS tools can be host-based, network-based, or both.

### Host-Based

A Host-Based IDS (HIDS) or IPS (HIPS) monitors activity on individual hosts or endpoints. It is designed to detect and prevent suspicious activity at the system level on a specific device for example a server, a desktop, or a virtual machine.

### How it works

1.	Monitors system activities: Tracks file integrity, system calls, log files and process behaviour.

2.	Analyses host data: Looks for suspicious changes in configuration files, unauthorised file access, or unusual activity within the system.

3.	Real-time alerts: Provides real-time notifications if it detects malware, unauthorised logins, or attempts to change critical files.

### Advantages	
- Granular Monitoring: Since HIDS works at the host level, it can detect insider threats, privilege escalation, and unauthorised file changes that may not be visible at the network level.	
- Resource Intensive: Running HIDS on every host in a network can consume significant CPU, memory, and disk resources on the machines being monitored.
- Detailed Insight: HIDS has access to detailed information about system processes, making it better at detecting sophisticated attacks targeting specific machines.	

### Disadvantages
- Limited Visibility: HIDS only monitors individual systems, meaning it cannot detect network-wide attacks. It lacks the big-picture view of the overall network.
- Encrypted Traffic Monitoring: It can analyse encrypted traffic at the endpoint, unlike NIDS, which may struggle with encryption unless it has decryption capabilities.	
- Decentralized Management: Monitoring multiple hosts requires separate installations, which can make management and coordination more complex.

### Network-based

A Network-Based IDS (NIDS) or IPS (NIPS) monitors and analyses traffic on a network. These typically include packet sniffers in key network areas to collect packets from a network tap or by sniffing wireless traffic.

### How it works

1.	Monitors network traffic: It inspects packets as they travel across the network, checking for signatures of known attacks or unusual traffic patterns.

2.	Real-time detection: Alerts administrators in real-time when it detects port scans, DDoS attacks, or other suspicious traffic.

3.	Network-wide coverage: NIDS can monitor all devices connected to the network, giving a broader view of the traffic and potential threats.

### Advantages	
- Network-wide Monitoring: NIDS can detect network-level threats like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, packet sniffing, or attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in network services.	
- Encrypted Traffic Limitation: NIDS struggles to inspect encrypted traffic unless it has access to encryption keys or is placed in a position where traffic can be decrypted (e.g., behind a proxy server).
- Centralized Management: Since NIDS is deployed at specific points in the network, it’s easier to manage centrally and apply updates, rules, and policies across the entire network.	

### Disadvantages
- Blind to Host-Level Attacks: NIDS cannot detect insider threats or host-level intrusions like file tampering or unauthorised user activity unless that behaviour generates suspicious network traffic.
- Non-intrusive: NIDS operates passively by listening to traffic, so it does not interfere with or consume resources on individual hosts.	
- False Positives: Since NIDS relies heavily on network patterns and signatures, it can produce a high number of false positives if network traffic is unusual but benign.


### Hybrid 

Many organisations use a Hybrid IDPS, combining the strengths of both HIDS and NIDS to provide more comprehensive protection. Hybrid systems collect data from both individual hosts and network traffic, offering both detailed system insight and broader network visibility. This approach reduces blind spots that either system might have on its own.

## Detection Methods

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) utilise a range of detection methods to identify suspicious or malicious activity in a network or on a host. These methods focus on different aspects of the traffic or behaviour they monitor, each with its strengths and weaknesses.

1.	Signature-based Detection:
Also known as pattern-matching detection, this method compares observed events such as network packets or system logs against a database of known attack patterns, also called "signatures." When it detects a match between the traffic and a signature, it raises an alert or takes action (in the case of IPS).

2.	Anomaly-based Detection:
Anomaly-based detection identifies deviations from normal baseline behaviour. It establishes a profile of typical activity and flags anything that falls outside these norms as potentially malicious.

3.	Heuristic-based Detection:
Heuristic-based detection uses predefined rules and algorithms to identify suspicious behaviour that might indicate a security threat. It relies on experience-based techniques to infer whether an action might be malicious.

4.	Hybrid Detection:
Hybrid detection methods combine two or more techniques for example signature-based, anomaly-based, and behaviour-based to improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives.
