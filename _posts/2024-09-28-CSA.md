## Introduction

Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA) is crucial for ensuring the security of computer systems, organisations, and databases. Without a strong level of comprehension, organisations risk breaches, data theft, and systems being compromised. Within this blog, I will explore what situational awareness entails, discuss key industry techniques, as well as provide relevant examples to reinforce understanding.

## What is Cyber Situational Awareness

Cyber Situational Awareness has many interpretations, however, the 3-Model definition provided by M. Endsley effectively illustrates the key components relevant to cyber situational awareness.

“Situation awareness is the perception of the elements of the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future.”

Below I will break down the three models provided in M. Endsley’s definition by presenting the definition, giving a relevant cyber example, and a rationale:

1. Perception (Level 1): Perception is defined as recognising the status, attributes, and dynamics of relevant elements in an environment. 
* Example: A system administrator notices unusual network traffic, such as a large number of login attempts from a foreign IP address. 
* Explanation: At this level, the administrator simply perceives raw data or cues from the environment but does not yet understand the significance. It is the first crucial step, as it enables the administrator to identify anomalies that could signal a potential threat.

2. Comprehension (Level 2): Comprehension is understanding what the perceived data means in the context of the situation, including its relevance and significance. 
* Example: The administrator understands that this unusual traffic could be indicative of a brute-force attack, where an attacker is trying multiple password combinations to gain unauthorised access.
* Explanation: This level involves making sense of the perceived information by integrating it with previous knowledge and experience to understand its implications, allowing the administrator to determine the severity and nature of the threat.

3. Projection (Level 3): Projection is anticipating future states or outcomes based on the current situation. 
* Example: The administrator predicts that if the attack continues, the system could be breached. As a result, they decide to take immediate action by blocking the IP address and initiating further security measures such as tightening firewall rules and enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* Explanation: At this level, the administrator predicts future events and their consequences, allowing for proactive decision-making and preventing the situation from escalating.

In this cyber scenario, the administrator first perceives the anomaly, understands its potential risk, and then projects the likely outcome if no action is taken, leading to preventative steps. This example identifies that for optimal situational awareness, there are four components an individual must adhere to:

1.	Know what the system is, and how it should work
2.	Track the digital information in the system
3.	Understand behaviours
4.	React appropriately


To properly follow these rules the individual can follow the OODA loop. OODA stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. It describes a continuous process of decision-making, often in fast-paced environments like combat, business, and most importantly cyber-security. Its relevance to cybersecurity lies in its emphasis on quick, informed decision-making to outmanoeuvre attackers. Below I will provide definitions and give relevant examples:

## OODA Loop

1. Observe: Gather data from the environment (network logs, alerts, traffic anomalies)
* Example: A security team notices an unusual activity, such as a sudden spike in data transfers or multiple failed login attempts from a suspicious IP.

2. Orient: Analyse the observed data and place it in context. This step involves understanding the situation by filtering the information through past experiences, known attack patterns, and threat intelligence.
* Example: The security team assesses that the unusual data transfer might indicate data exfiltration and the failed login attempts could be an attempt at unauthorised access

3. Decide: Choose a course of action based on the analysis. This could involve isolating a system, blocking traffic, or preparing for a defensive move.
* Example: After orienting, the team decides that the best immediate response is to block the suspicious IP address, disable the compromised account, and strengthen monitoring across the system.

4. Act: Finally the team needs to implement the decision and take action to mitigate the threat. Once the action is taken, the cycle repeats; where new data will be observed, re-analysed, and followed by further decisions if necessary.
* Example: the security team enforces the block and deploys additional security measures, like updating firewall rules and running a forensic analysis to see if any data was stolen.

OODA, the 3-model definition, and the four components all link together to create a cohesive understanding of the environment. While the Endsley model explains the cognitive stages involved in understanding a situation, the OODA loop provides a practical framework for decision-making and rapid response. To further understanding I will provide examples of relevant OODA attacks and label the relevant 3-model elements with L1, L2 and L3 respectively.

## Phishing Attack
* Observe (L1): A user reports receiving a suspicious email with a link that requests login credentials
* Orient (L2): Security analysts recognise that the email is part of a larger phishing campaign aimed at stealing login credentials to compromise multiple accounts
* Decide (L3): The team decides to blacklist the phishing URL, alert all employees about the threat, and review logs for any successful credential compromises.
* Act: The URL is blocked, users are informed, and additional monitoring is set up to detect any further phishing attempts.

## Ransomware Attack
* Observe (L1): A system starts encrypting files unusually fast, and ransom notes appear in file directories.
* Orient (L2): The security team identifies this as a ransomware attack, where the attacker encrypts the organisation's files and demands payment for decryption.
* Decide (L3): The team decides to isolate the infected systems from the network to stop the spread, shut down any unnecessary services, and initiate incident response protocols.
* Act: They quarantine the affected systems, restore files from backups, and investigate the origin of the ransomware attack to prevent recurrence. 
  

## Conclusion
In this blog, we explored the 3-level definition of situational awareness and how perception, comprehension, and projection are critical in mitigating cyber threats. We also discussed the OODA loop, a powerful decision-making framework, and demonstrated its connection with situational awareness through real-world examples. With a thorough understanding of these techniques, individuals can confidently develop swift and effective mitigation strategies for any cyber threat.
